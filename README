# Ints

Ints is a simple, array-oriented programming language built from scratch in C++, designed around a single data type: arrays of integers.

It supports:
- Fixed and growable arrays
- User-defined functions with strict input/output arity
- Arithmetic, slicing, method chaining, and conditionals
- A minimal and expressive syntax for manipulating integer sequences

> This was my first real project in C++, which I rarely use. It’s not elegant, but it works, and honestly, that’s all I wanted.
